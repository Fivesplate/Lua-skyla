# Lua Skyla

Lua Skyla is a rust-based fork of Lua that rewrites the core in Rust for better safety and performance, 
while using the D language to handle advanced math and parsing tasks. It keeps Luaâ€™s simplicity and compatibility but adds improved speed and reliability, making it ideal for game scripting and embedded use.
